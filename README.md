This code was developed for the thesis entitled: "A contribution to the dynamics of epilepsy: identification and control for seizure attenuation".
Essentially, the code was developed on the Spyder platform and it consists six separate files:
- “Applying PSD and HT to analyze non-seizure and seizure patterns from real signals.py”: applies Power Spectral Density (PSD) and the Hilbert Transform (HT) to analyze non-seizure and seizure patterns from real signals of patients;
- “Applying orthogonal polynomials for identifying state-space systems from real brain activity.py”: applies orthogonal polynomials using the Fourier basis and a system identification approach to obtain state-space models for real brain activity;
- “LMIs for designing a controller to linear state-space models.py”: applies an optimization routine using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) to obtain the gains of the controller that reconstructs and attenuates the epileptiform activity artificially;
“Model reference controllers with fixed gains for linear models using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator.py”: applies the fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator in closed-loop to reconstruct and attenuate the epileptiform activity using the concept of Model Reference Controllers (MRC) with fixed gains;
“Model reference controllers with adaptive gains for linear models using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator.py”: applies the fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator in closed-loop to reconstruct and attenuate the epileptiform activity using the concept of Model Reference Controllers (MRC) with adaptive gains;
-”Principal component analysis for analyzing clusters of non-seizure and seizure features.py”: applies the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to study clisters of features from non-seizure and seizure signals using PSDs.

Note: the signals analyzed inside the codes are restricted for use inside the facilities of the CHUV, and are yet to be made available in future publications.
